//String
console.log("Javascript is easier than i taught");

//Handling strings with apostrophes
console.log("i'm a developer");
console.log("i'am 19  years old");
console.log(`i'am using template strings to handle the apostrophes`); //template strings

//Adding strings Together
//string can be added together using the + operator
//this process is also called string concatenation
console.log("super" + "man");
console.log("1" + "1"); //give us a string of 11

//Number
console.log(123456789);

//Adding numbers together
//number in javascript behave just like number in math
console.log(1 + 1); //output

//Subtracting, multiplying and dividing numbers
//You can also subtract, multiply or even divide the numbers with -, * and / respectively.
console.log(22 - 2);
console.log(22 * 2);
console.log(22 / 2);

//You can also find the remainder of a number with the modulus (%) operator.
console.log(22 % 5);

//Boolean
//Booleans are very much like light switches. They can only be “switched on” (true) or “switched off” (false).
console.log(true);
console.log(false);
